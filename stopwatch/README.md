# Stopwatch

This project uses the evaluation board EK-TM4C123GXL to create a stopwatch using a timer interrupt.

A timer is needed to get accurate 1/100 of a second invocation of the stop watch program.
This project is built against the custom adapter board which uses SSI2 instead of the breadboard which uses SSI0.
